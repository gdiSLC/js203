          <h1>Setup</h1>

          <p>When you work with JavaScript APIs, you have to be running a server for your API call to be successful (this is a security thing). There is an easy(ish) way to run a local server on a Mac (<a href="local-server.html">instructions if you were curious</a>), but for this class we are going to use JSBin instead. <strong>Even if you know how to run a server on your Mac, please use JSBin for this exercise.</strong></p>

          <h1>Instructions</h1>

          <p>In this exercise, you'll try out using several JS snippet APIs to bring more functionality into the webpage.</p>

          <p><em>Note</em>: some of these steps require you to have accounts on these services. If you don't already have an account, you can either sign up for an account or skip that step.</p>

          <ol>
            <li><a href="http://jsbin.com/desay/2/edit?html,js">View the starter file on JSBin</a> - do not try to edit the starter file</li>
            <li>Click <strong>File &gt; Clone</strong> to create a copy of the file</li>
            <li>Go to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/+/web/+1button/">Google+ button docs</a> and generate the code for a Google+ button with no annotation and a medium size. Insert that so it shows up next to the header of the webpage.</li>
            <li>Go to the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/tweet-button">Tweet button docs</a> and read about the Tweet button. Find the HTML/SCRIPT tag for adding it, and paste that into your webpage, at the bottom near the counter.</li>
            <li>Read the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/like-button">Facebook 'Like' button docs</a> and add a 'Like' button for any page you want.</li>
            <li>Modify the share URL or HTML according to the docs to specify hash tags and change it so that it doesn't show the counter.</li>
            <li>Bonus: Using JavaScript, generate a Tweet button for each video, and display it when the video is clicked. The text for each tweet button should be the video title.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Make sure that you use your console and developer tools to make debugging easier while working on this. Check for errors, and use console.log() to figure out how far your code makes it, and what the values of your variables are along the way. <em>Using JSBin, you'll need to click the "Console" tap in the top middle. Your developer console might print extra information.</em></p>

          <h1>Solution</h1>

          <p>Click the <strong>JavaScript</strong> button in the middle to see the solution.</p>
