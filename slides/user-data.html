<h2>User data</h2>

<p>User data APIs typically require user authentication (not always) and provide you with information about the user, or a group of users.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Social networks: list of a user's Facebook friends</li>
  <li>Multimedia: music, videos, or photos uploaded by a user</li>
  <li>Documents: files saved or shared by a user</li>
</ul>
