<h2>Enhancing with APIs: Public Data</h2>

<p>There is a huge amount of public data available, and APIs make that data available to use in a structured way.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I don't want to install and manage a database of every address <em>in the world</em>, so I use the Google Maps API to geocode an address.</li>
  <li>CTA API: Information about train arrival times and alerts</li>
</ul>
