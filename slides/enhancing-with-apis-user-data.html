<h2>Enhancing with APIs: User Data</h2>

<p>We also use APIs to access data from other products and integrate them with our own. Users use multiple products and expect for them to work together - synergy.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Signing in with Facebook to find your friends on Foursquare or Yelp</li>
  <li>Using Google Calendar events in your iPhone's calendar app</li>
</ul>
